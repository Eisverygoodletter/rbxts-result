# @rbxts/result
An implementation of Rust-like `Result`s for `roblox-ts`.
This package makes writing functions that can fail easier.

# Considering Using [rbxts-rust-classes](https://github.com/Dionysusnu/rbxts-rust-classes) Instead. This package was written before I found that the other package existed.
This package only provides the `Result` class.
